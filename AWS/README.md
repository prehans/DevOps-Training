# About Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is a model for delivering computing services such as storage, processing power, and applications over the internet, instead of hosting and maintaining physical servers and hardware. Users access these resources through the internet ("the cloud") on a pay-as-you-go basis, which provides flexibility, scalability, and cost-efficiency.

### Key Characteristics of Cloud Computing:

1. **On-Demand Self-Service**: Users can access computing resources as needed, without requiring human intervention.
2. **Broad Network Access**: Services are available over the internet from any location and device.
3. **Resource Pooling**: Multiple users share the same physical resources (servers, storage) through virtualization.
4. **Rapid Elasticity**: Cloud resources can be scaled up or down dynamically according to demand.
5. **Measured Service**: Usage is monitored, controlled, and reported, ensuring that customers pay only for what they use.

### Types of Cloud Computing Services:

1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Offers virtualized computing resources like virtual machines (VMs), storage, and networks. Example: Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2.
2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Provides a platform that allows developers to build, run, and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. Example: Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure.
3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. Example: Google Workspace, Microsoft 365.

### Deployment Models:

1. **Public Cloud**: Services provided by third-party vendors over the internet to the general public. Example: AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud.
2. **Private Cloud**: Services are maintained on a private network, typically by a single organization for its own use, offering more control and security.
3. **Hybrid Cloud**: A combination of both public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.

### Benefits of Cloud Computing:

- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces capital expenditure (CapEx) by eliminating the need to buy hardware and manage data centers.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale resources to handle increased workloads.
- **Flexibility and Mobility**: Access resources from anywhere with an internet connection.

# AWS EBS (Elastic Block Store)

Amazon **EBS (Elastic Block Store)** is a block storage service designed for use with Amazon EC2 instances. EBS provides persistent storage volumes that can be attached to EC2 instances and are well-suited for databases, file systems, and other applications requiring reliable, high-performance storage.

Here are the key details about EBS volumes:

### 1. **Types of EBS Volumes**

EBS offers several types of volumes optimized for different use cases:

- **General Purpose SSD (gp2/gp3)**:
  - **gp2**: Provides baseline performance with burst capability.
  - **gp3**: Offers consistent performance with customizable IOPS and throughput, decoupling performance from capacity.
  - Use case: Most workloads, including boot volumes, small to medium databases, and development environments.
- **Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1/io2)**:

  - Designed for high-performance applications that require high IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second).
  - **io2** offers better durability (99.999%) and is often used for critical databases like Oracle, MySQL, and MongoDB.
  - Use case: Mission-critical applications, large databases, and workloads requiring consistent IOPS.

- **Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)**:

  - Provides low-cost, high-throughput storage for data that is accessed sequentially.
  - Use case: Large-scale data warehouses, big data processing, and log storage.

- **Cold HDD (sc1)**:
  - Lowest cost storage, designed for infrequently accessed data.
  - Use case: Archival storage and infrequently accessed data.

### 2. **EBS Volume Characteristics**

- **Persistence**: EBS volumes are persistent, meaning data is retained even if the EC2 instance is stopped, restarted, or terminated (except for the root volume if specified to delete on termination).
- **Scalability**: You can increase the size of an EBS volume, adjust performance characteristics (IOPS and throughput), and change volume types without stopping the instance.

- **Resilience**: EBS volumes are automatically replicated within the same availability zone (AZ) to prevent data loss due to hardware failure.

- **Snapshots**: EBS allows you to take point-in-time snapshots of volumes. Snapshots are stored in Amazon S3 and can be used to restore volumes or create new ones in different availability zones or regions.

### 3. **EBS Volume Attachment**

- **Attach to EC2 Instances**: An EBS volume can be attached to any running EC2 instance in the same availability zone. Once attached, it appears as a block device that can be formatted with a file system and mounted.
- **Multiple Attachments**: Only io1/io2 volumes can be attached to multiple instances simultaneously, using the **multi-attach** feature. However, this is typically used for clustered or shared file systems.
- **Detach**: EBS volumes can be detached from an EC2 instance and reattached to another instance. This makes it easy to migrate storage between instances.

### 4. **Performance Factors**

- **IOPS (Input/Output Operations per Second)**:
  - gp3, io1, and io2 volumes allow you to provision specific IOPS levels.
  - gp2 and gp3 volumes provide baseline IOPS with the ability to burst for short periods.
- **Throughput**: The speed at which data is read from or written to the volume. Some volume types like st1 and sc1 are optimized for high throughput.

### 5. **Data Encryption**

- EBS volumes can be encrypted to ensure data-at-rest security. EBS encryption uses AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to handle encryption keys.
  - Encryption applies to data in transit between the EC2 instance and EBS.
  - Snapshots created from encrypted volumes and volumes created from encrypted snapshots are also encrypted.

### 6. **Snapshots and Backup**

- **Snapshots**: You can take incremental snapshots of EBS volumes, which are stored in S3. Snapshots can be used to restore a volume or create new ones.
- **Automated Backups**: AWS provides automated backup policies to schedule periodic snapshots, making it easier to manage backups and disaster recovery.

### 7. **Resizing EBS Volumes**

- You can resize an EBS volume without downtime. This includes increasing the volume size, adjusting the IOPS (for io1/io2/gp3), and switching between different volume types.

### 8. **Pricing**

- **Pay-per-Use**: EBS pricing is based on the type and size of the volume, provisioned IOPS, and any additional snapshots you store.
- **Snapshot Costs**: You are charged for the amount of data stored in S3, which includes the data in the snapshot and incremental changes since the last snapshot.

### 9. **Use Cases**

- **Boot Volumes**: EBS volumes are often used to store operating systems and boot files for EC2 instances.
- **Database Storage**: High-performance EBS volumes (like io2) are used for running databases that require low-latency, high-reliability storage.
- **Big Data**: Throughput-optimized volumes (st1) are suitable for data-intensive applications like Hadoop clusters.
- **Backup and Disaster Recovery**: Snapshots provide an easy way to create backups of volumes and restore them when needed.

### 10. **Limitations**

- **Availability Zone Bound**: EBS volumes are tied to a single AZ and must be detached and reattached to migrate between AZs.
- **Maximum Size**: The maximum size for an EBS volume is 64 TiB.

# AWS Amazon Machine Image (AMI)

An **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)** is a pre-configured virtual machine image that provides the information required to launch an **EC2 instance** in the AWS cloud. AMIs include essential components like the operating system, application software, and configurations, making them fundamental to creating, deploying, and scaling EC2 instances.

### Key Components of an AMI:

1. **Root Volume Template**:

   - The AMI defines the root volume, which includes an operating system, the application server, and applications installed on that OS.
   - The root volume is typically stored on Amazon EBS or, for instance-store-backed instances, as an instance store.

2. **Launch Permissions**:

   - AMIs control which AWS accounts can launch instances from them. You can make an AMI private, share it with specific AWS accounts, or make it publicly accessible.

3. **Block Device Mapping**:
   - This specifies the volumes (e.g., EBS volumes) that will be attached to the instance when it is launched. It includes the root volume and any additional data volumes that might be needed.

### Types of AMIs:

1. **Amazon-provided AMIs**:

   - These are created and maintained by AWS and are the most common starting point for launching instances.
   - Examples: Standard Linux distributions (Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, Red Hat), Windows Server, etc.

2. **AWS Marketplace AMIs**:

   - Pre-configured AMIs available in the AWS Marketplace, which may include commercial software like databases, web servers, development environments, etc.

3. **Custom AMIs**:

   - Created by users based on their needs. For example, after setting up a specific application environment on an EC2 instance, you can create an AMI of that setup to use for future instances.
   - Custom AMIs are useful for cloning environments, ensuring consistency across instances, and scaling applications quickly.

4. **Community AMIs**:
   - AMIs shared by the AWS community that are publicly available and can be used by any AWS account.

### AMI Lifecycle:

1. **Launch an Instance**:

   - When you launch an EC2 instance, you must select an AMI to define what software will be installed on the instance.

2. **Instance Creation**:

   - Once an instance is running, you can modify its configuration (e.g., install software, change configurations) and then create a new custom AMI from that instance.

3. **Reuse and Scaling**:

   - Using an AMI allows you to quickly and consistently launch multiple EC2 instances with the same setup, which is useful for scaling or disaster recovery.

4. **Retirement**:
   - If an AMI is no longer needed, you can deregister it, preventing further use, but any existing instances launched from that AMI will continue to run.

### How AMIs Work:

1. **Region-Specific**:

   - AMIs are created in specific AWS regions and can only be used to launch EC2 instances within that region. However, you can copy an AMI to other regions if needed.

2. **Types of Backing Store**:
   - **EBS-backed AMI**:
     - The root device for an instance launched from an EBS-backed AMI is an EBS volume created from the AMI.
     - EBS-backed instances can be stopped and restarted, preserving data between reboots.
   - **Instance Store-backed AMI**:
     - The root device for an instance store-backed AMI uses the instance store, which is ephemeral storage directly attached to the host.
     - Data is lost when the instance stops or terminates, and it cannot be restarted (only rebooted).

### Common Use Cases:

1. **Scaling Applications**:

   - AMIs allow you to replicate an EC2 instanceâ€™s setup to launch identical instances, making it easy to scale applications by deploying pre-configured instances.

2. **Backup and Recovery**:

   - You can create an AMI from a running instance to use as a backup. If the instance fails or needs to be moved, you can launch a new instance from the AMI.

3. **Environment Standardization**:
   - Using custom AMIs ensures that all team members or servers are running the same environment, simplifying application development and operations.

### AMI Creation Process:

1. **Prepare the Instance**:

   - Launch an EC2 instance and install/configure the software and settings you want included in the AMI.

2. **Create the AMI**:

   - From the EC2 Dashboard, select the instance, right-click, and choose **Create Image**. This will create a new AMI based on that instance.

3. **Launch Instances**:

   - Once the AMI is created, you can launch new EC2 instances from that AMI, replicating the environment and software.

4. **Distribute the AMI**:
   - You can share the AMI with other AWS accounts or regions. You can also publish it to the AWS Marketplace or make it public for others to use.

### How to Choose an AMI:

When selecting or creating an AMI, consider the following factors:

- **Operating System**: Linux, Windows, or specific distributions like Ubuntu, Red Hat, etc.
- **Software Pre-installed**: AMIs may come with specific software (e.g., LAMP stack, MySQL).
- **Region**: Ensure the AMI is available in the region where you want to launch your instance.
- **Instance Store vs. EBS**: Choose based on whether you need persistent storage (EBS) or ephemeral storage (Instance Store).
- **Performance Requirements**: Some AMIs are optimized for specific performance needs like HPC (High-Performance Computing) workloads.

### Key Advantages of AMIs:

- **Fast Provisioning**: AMIs enable rapid deployment of pre-configured environments.
- **Consistency**: Ensure consistent application deployment across multiple instances.
- **Customizable**: Create custom AMIs tailored to specific workloads or applications.

### Summary:

An **AMI** is the blueprint for your EC2 instance, defining the operating system, application server, and any software installed. It allows for quick and efficient launching of new instances with the same configuration. AMIs are region-specific but can be copied across regions for flexibility. Users can choose from a variety of AMIs provided by AWS, the AWS Marketplace, or create custom AMIs for specific use cases.

# Security Groups

A **Security Group** in Amazon EC2 acts as a virtual firewall that controls the inbound and outbound traffic for your EC2 instances. It plays a key role in ensuring the security of your resources within AWS by allowing or denying specific types of network traffic.

### Key Concepts of Security Groups:

1. **Instance-Level Firewall**:

   - Security groups are applied to **instances**, not individual resources within an instance. All rules in a security group apply to every instance that the group is associated with.

2. **Stateful Nature**:

   - Security groups are **stateful**, meaning that if you allow an inbound connection, the return traffic for that connection is automatically allowed, even if you don't explicitly allow outbound traffic for that connection.

3. **Allow Rules Only**:

   - Security groups work by allowing traffic. You cannot explicitly block traffic using security groups (you'd use **Network ACLs** for that). If there is no allow rule for a certain type of traffic, it is denied by default.

4. **Inbound and Outbound Rules**:

   - **Inbound rules** control the incoming traffic to your instance.
   - **Outbound rules** control the outgoing traffic from your instance.

5. **Protocol and Port Control**:

   - You can specify traffic by **protocol** (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP) and **port number** (e.g., port 22 for SSH, port 80 for HTTP, port 443 for HTTPS).

6. **Source and Destination**:
   - For inbound rules, you define the **source** of the traffic (IP address, CIDR block, or another security group).
   - For outbound rules, you define the **destination** (IP address, CIDR block, or another security group).
7. **Security Group Scope**:
   - A security group can be associated with multiple instances.
   - Instances can have multiple security groups attached to them, and the rules from all attached security groups are evaluated to determine access.

### Common Use Cases:

1. **Web Servers**:

   - Allow inbound HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) traffic from any IP address (0.0.0.0/0).
   - Allow outbound traffic to any IP address for updates or communication with external services.

   Example Inbound Rules:

   - Type: HTTP, Protocol: TCP, Port: 80, Source: 0.0.0.0/0
   - Type: HTTPS, Protocol: TCP, Port: 443, Source: 0.0.0.0/0

2. **SSH Access to EC2 Instance**:

   - Allow inbound SSH (port 22) access only from a specific IP address or range, preventing unauthorized login attempts.

   Example Inbound Rule:

   - Type: SSH, Protocol: TCP, Port: 22, Source: **your IP address** or **CIDR block** (e.g., 203.0.113.0/24)

3. **Database Access**:

   - Allow inbound MySQL or PostgreSQL access (port 3306 or 5432) from a specific set of trusted instances or IP ranges.

   Example Inbound Rule:

   - Type: MySQL/Aurora, Protocol: TCP, Port: 3306, Source: 10.0.0.0/16 (private IP range for instances in the same VPC).

### Example Security Group:

Imagine you're running a web application with a database backend, and you want to secure it:

1. **Web Server Security Group**:

   - Inbound Rules:
     - Allow HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) traffic from the internet (0.0.0.0/0).
     - Allow SSH (22) traffic only from your IP address.
   - Outbound Rules:
     - Allow all outbound traffic.

2. **Database Server Security Group**:
   - Inbound Rules:
     - Allow MySQL (3306) traffic only from the web server's security group.
   - Outbound Rules:
     - Allow all outbound traffic.

### Security Group Example:

- **Inbound Rules**:
  | Type | Protocol | Port Range | Source |
  |-------------|----------|------------|-----------------------|
  | HTTP | TCP | 80 | 0.0.0.0/0 |
  | HTTPS | TCP | 443 | 0.0.0.0/0 |
  | SSH | TCP | 22 | Your IP (e.g., 203.x.x.x) |

- **Outbound Rules**:
  | Type | Protocol | Port Range | Destination |
  |-------------|----------|------------|-----------------------|
  | All Traffic | All | All | 0.0.0.0/0 |

### Best Practices for Security Groups:

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**:

   - Only allow the minimum amount of traffic necessary for your application to function. For example, don't allow all IP addresses to access your instances if it's unnecessary.

2. **Limit SSH and RDP Access**:

   - Restrict SSH (port 22) or RDP (port 3389) access to trusted IP addresses. If possible, use VPNs or bastion hosts to further secure access.

3. **Use Descriptive Security Group Names**:

   - Give security groups meaningful names and descriptions so you can easily identify their purpose.

4. **Regularly Review and Audit Rules**:

   - Periodically review your security groups to ensure you're not allowing unnecessary access.

5. **Use Security Groups with VPCs**:
   - Security groups work at the **instance level**, but when used in conjunction with **VPC** (Virtual Private Cloud), they provide a more robust security model that includes **network ACLs** and **route tables**.

### Summary:

- **Security Groups** act as a virtual firewall for EC2 instances, controlling inbound and outbound traffic.
- They allow only explicitly permitted traffic and block everything else by default.
- You can configure rules based on IP ranges, protocols, and ports.
- Security groups are stateful, and they allow return traffic for any allowed connection.

# AWS EC2 Image Builder

**AWS EC2 Image Builder** is a service that simplifies the process of creating, maintaining, and managing customized Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). It automates the process of building, testing, and distributing AMIs, ensuring that images are always up-to-date with the latest patches, software versions, and configurations.

Hereâ€™s an overview of **AWS EC2 Image Builder**:

### Key Features of EC2 Image Builder:

1. **Automated Image Creation**:

   - You can automate the creation of AMIs by specifying a **workflow** that includes the source image, software packages, custom scripts, and configuration settings.
   - The service will automatically create, test, and distribute new AMIs based on your schedule.

2. **Versioning and Pipeline Management**:

   - EC2 Image Builder manages the versioning of your AMIs. Each time a new image is created, it increments the version, allowing you to track updates and roll back if needed.
   - **Image pipelines** define the steps and rules for creating an image, including validation and distribution.

3. **Built-in Security and Compliance**:

   - The service integrates with AWS services like **AWS Inspector**, allowing you to include security and compliance checks in the AMI creation process.
   - This ensures that your images are always up-to-date with security patches and compliant with internal or regulatory standards.

4. **Customizable Components**:

   - You can create reusable components such as software packages, configurations, and test scripts, which can be applied across multiple images.
   - Components define the software and configurations that will be installed in the AMI, such as installing packages or running scripts.

5. **Testing and Validation**:

   - EC2 Image Builder includes automated **testing and validation** steps in the pipeline to verify that the AMI is functional and meets specified requirements before itâ€™s distributed.
   - This helps catch issues early and ensures that only validated images are deployed.

6. **Multi-Region and Multi-Platform Support**:
   - You can build and distribute images across multiple AWS regions, ensuring that they are available globally.
   - EC2 Image Builder supports multiple operating systems, including **Linux** and **Windows**.

### Workflow of EC2 Image Builder:

1. **Source Image**: Start with a base image, such as an existing Amazon-provided AMI or a custom image.
2. **Custom Components**: Define the custom components (e.g., software, settings, patches) to apply to the base image.
3. **Build Recipe**: Specify a build recipe that includes the source image and the components.
4. **Testing**: Define validation steps to test the AMI after it is built, ensuring that it functions correctly and meets security standards.
5. **Distribution**: Once the AMI passes the tests, it is distributed across regions and made available for use.

### Steps to Create an Image with EC2 Image Builder:

1. **Create a Recipe**: Define the base AMI and the components that will be installed (software, configurations, patches).
2. **Set Up a Pipeline**: Create a pipeline that defines the build schedule (e.g., weekly, monthly) and the testing process.
3. **Build and Test**: EC2 Image Builder automatically builds the AMI, applies the defined components, and runs tests to ensure functionality.
4. **Distribute**: Once the image is validated, it can be distributed across AWS regions.

### Benefits of EC2 Image Builder:

- **Time-saving**: Automates the process of creating and maintaining images, reducing manual efforts.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that all AMIs are consistent and up-to-date with security patches and configurations.

- **Security and Compliance**: Integrates security checks and compliance requirements directly into the image-building process.

### Example Use Case:

- An organization wants to regularly update their EC2 instances with the latest software and security patches. Using EC2 Image Builder, they can automate the creation of new AMIs every month, applying the latest patches and configurations, testing the images for functionality, and then automatically deploying them across different AWS regions.

### Pricing:

- EC2 Image Builder is a free service. You only pay for the underlying AWS resources that you use, such as EC2 instances, S3 storage for logs and images, and other AWS services that the pipeline interacts with.

### Conclusion:

AWS EC2 Image Builder provides a powerful, automated way to create, maintain, and distribute AMIs with minimal manual effort. By automating the image creation process, it ensures that your instances are always running the latest, secure, and compliant software, reducing operational overhead and improving security.
