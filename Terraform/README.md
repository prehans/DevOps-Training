Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp. It allows users to define and provision data center infrastructure using a high-level configuration language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) or JSON.

### Key Features:

1. **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is defined in code, allowing versioning, reusability, and automation.
2. **Provider Support**: Terraform supports a wide range of cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) and on-premise services (VMware, OpenStack, etc.).
3. **Declarative Language**: You specify _what_ infrastructure you want, and Terraform figures out _how_ to achieve it.
4. **State Management**: Terraform keeps track of resources and their current state using a state file. This allows it to track changes and apply only the necessary modifications.
5. **Modules**: Reusable blocks of Terraform configuration, enabling users to manage infrastructure components more easily.

### Basic Workflow:

1. **Write**: Create configuration files that describe the desired infrastructure.
2. **Plan**: Terraform analyzes the infrastructure plan to show the proposed changes.
3. **Apply**: Terraform provisions and manages the infrastructure.
4. **Destroy**: Tear down the infrastructure when it's no longer needed.

### Use Cases:

- Provisioning cloud resources (VMs, databases, networking, etc.).
- Managing complex infrastructure across multiple environments.
- Automating the deployment and scaling of applications.

### Example:

Hereâ€™s a simple example of a Terraform configuration for deploying an AWS EC2 instance:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

In this example, Terraform is configured to create an EC2 instance using the specified AMI and instance type in the AWS region "us-west-2".

Terraform is widely used for managing cloud infrastructure in a repeatable and scalable way, making it popular in DevOps environments for automating infrastructure deployment.

- **`terraform init`**: Prepare local environment for setting up the cloud infrastructure.
- **`terraform plan`**: It tells how many resources you are going to add update of delete.
- **`terraform apply`**: Run the virtual instances on cloud platforms.
- **`terraform destroy`**: Destroys all infrastructure managed by the Terraform configuration, instances or resources.

In Terraform, the `variable.tf` file is used to define variables that can be reused across your configuration files. This allows you to parameterize your Terraform configurations, making them more dynamic and flexible. Here's an example of how you can define variables for the region, instance count, and instance type in a `variables.tf` file:

# Terraform variables

https://jhooq.com/terraform-input-variables/

### `variables.tf`

```hcl
# Define the AWS region as a variable
variable "aws_region" {
  description = "The AWS region where resources will be created"
  type        = string
  default     = "us-west-2"
}

# Define the instance type as a variable
variable "instance_type" {
  description = "The type of instance to create"
  type        = string
  default     = "t2.micro"
}

# Define the number of instances to create as a variable
variable "instance_count" {
  description = "The number of EC2 instances to create"
  type        = number
  default     = 3
}

# Define the AMI ID as a variable
variable "ami_id" {
  description = "The AMI ID for the EC2 instance"
  type        = string
  default     = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"  # Replace with your AMI ID
}
```

### `main.tf` (updated to use variables)

```hcl
# Use the AWS provider with the region from the variable
provider "aws" {
  region = var.aws_region
}

# Create a security group allowing SSH and HTTP traffic
resource "aws_security_group" "web_sg" {
  name        = "web_sg"
  description = "Allow SSH and HTTP traffic"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]  # Allow SSH from anywhere (use with caution)
  }

  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]  # Allow HTTP from anywhere
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"  # Allow all outbound traffic
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

# Create multiple EC2 instances using the instance_count variable
resource "aws_instance" "my_instance" {
  count         = var.instance_count   # Number of instances based on variable
  ami           = var.ami_id           # AMI ID from variable
  instance_type = var.instance_type    # Instance type from variable
  security_groups = [aws_security_group.web_sg.name]

  tags = {
    Name = "My_Terraform_EC2_${count.index}"  # Unique name for each instance
  }
}
```

### Key Points:

- **Variables**: Defined in `variables.tf`, these can be reused in other configuration files like `main.tf`.
- **Defaults**: Each variable has a default value, but you can override these values by passing them via a `terraform.tfvars` file or command line during execution.
- **Flexibility**: This makes the configuration more flexible and customizable without changing the core code.

### Steps to use:

1. **Initialize Terraform**:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

2. **Plan the deployment**:

   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

3. **Apply the configuration**:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

With this setup, you can easily change parameters (like region, instance type, or number of instances) without modifying the core logic of your Terraform configuration.

# Terraform Locals

https://jhooq.com/how-to-use-terraform-locals/

In Terraform, **locals** are used to assign local values to simplify complex expressions or avoid repeating the same value multiple times within a module. These local values are scoped to the module in which they are defined, meaning they are not exposed outside the module and cannot be passed as inputs.

### Syntax:

Local values are defined inside a `locals` block and referenced with the `local.<variable_name>` syntax.

### Example of Terraform `locals`:

#### `main.tf`

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

# Define local values
locals {
  environment       = "production"
  instance_type     = "t2.micro"
  instance_count    = 3
  app_name          = "MyApp"
  full_instance_name = "${local.app_name}-${local.environment}"
}

# Create multiple EC2 instances using locals
resource "aws_instance" "my_instance" {
  count         = local.instance_count        # Use local value for count
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"     # Replace with appropriate AMI
  instance_type = local.instance_type         # Use local value for instance type
  security_groups = [aws_security_group.web_sg.name]

  tags = {
    Name = "${local.full_instance_name}-${count.index}"  # Use local value for name
  }
}
```

### Key Points:

- **`locals` block**: This is where you define the local values. In this example, variables like `environment`, `instance_type`, `app_name`, and `full_instance_name` are declared.
- **Referencing**: You reference a local variable using `local.<variable_name>`. For example, `local.instance_type` or `local.full_instance_name`.
- **Reusability**: Local values are useful to store computed values or values that are reused multiple times in the same module.

### Example Breakdown:

- **`local.environment`**: Stores the environment name (`production`).
- **`local.full_instance_name`**: Concatenates the application name (`MyApp`) and the environment name (`production`), resulting in `MyApp-production`.
- **`local.instance_count`**: Specifies that 3 instances should be created.

### Benefits of Locals:

1. **Simplify Code**: Instead of repeating the same values across your Terraform files, you can define them once and reuse them.
2. **Improve Readability**: Local variables make the code more readable by breaking down complex expressions into simpler parts.
3. **Avoid Duplication**: Prevents hardcoding the same value in multiple places, making the configuration easier to maintain and modify.

### When to Use Locals:

- When you need to reuse the same values across multiple resources.
- When you have complex expressions that can be simplified.
- When you need computed values (e.g., concatenating strings or performing calculations).

Locals are an excellent way to streamline your Terraform configurations without making your code dependent on external inputs or exposing values externally.

# Terraform Workspaces

https://jhooq.com/terraform-workspaces/

In Terraform, **workspaces** are a way to manage multiple environments (like `dev`, `qa`, `prod`) within the same configuration. Each workspace can have its own state and resources, allowing you to manage isolated environments using a single set of Terraform code.

### Key Features of Workspaces:

- **Multiple Environments**: Workspaces help you manage different environments (e.g., dev, qa, prod) with the same configuration.
- **Separate States**: Each workspace maintains its own state file, ensuring that resources created in one workspace do not interfere with those in another.
- **Easy Switching**: You can easily switch between workspaces using Terraform commands.

### Workspace Commands:

1. **Create a New Workspace**

   ```bash
   terraform workspace new <workspace_name>
   ```

   - This command creates a new workspace with the specified name.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     terraform workspace new dev
     ```

2. **List All Workspaces**

   ```bash
   terraform workspace list
   ```

   - Lists all available workspaces in the current configuration.
   - Example output:
     ```bash
     default
     * dev
     qa
     prod
     ```

3. **Show the Current Workspace**

   ```bash
   terraform workspace show
   ```

   - Displays the name of the current workspace.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     dev
     ```

4. **Switch to a Workspace**

   ```bash
   terraform workspace select <workspace_name>
   ```

   - Switches to the specified workspace.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     terraform workspace select prod
     ```

5. **Delete a Workspace**
   ```bash
   terraform workspace delete <workspace_name>
   ```
   - Deletes a specified workspace. Note that you cannot delete the workspace you are currently in.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     terraform workspace delete qa
     ```

### Example Usage of Workspaces:

Suppose you are working with different environments (`dev`, `qa`, `prod`). Instead of creating separate Terraform files for each environment, you can use workspaces to manage them within the same configuration.

1. **Define Resources in `main.tf`:**

   ```hcl
   provider "aws" {
     region = "us-west-2"
   }

   resource "aws_instance" "my_instance" {
     count         = var.instance_count
     ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"  # Replace with valid AMI ID
     instance_type = "t2.micro"

     tags = {
       Name = "${terraform.workspace}-instance"
     }
   }

   variable "instance_count" {
     default = 1
   }
   ```

2. **Switch to `dev` Workspace:**

   ```bash
   terraform workspace new dev
   ```

3. **Run Terraform Commands for `dev`:**

   ```bash
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

4. **Switch to `prod` Workspace:**

   ```bash
   terraform workspace select prod
   ```

5. **Run Terraform Commands for `prod`:**
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

### Benefits of Using Workspaces:

- **Isolated State**: Workspaces maintain separate state files for each environment, ensuring that changes in one environment do not affect another.
- **Code Reusability**: You can use the same Terraform configuration to manage multiple environments, avoiding duplication of code.
- **Environment-Specific Configurations**: You can dynamically adjust configurations based on the current workspace using `terraform.workspace`, enabling environment-specific settings.

### Workspace Considerations:

- **Not for Every Use Case**: Workspaces are useful for isolated environments like `dev`, `qa`, and `prod`, but they might not be ideal for large-scale infrastructure management with complex branching.
- **Workspaces are Local to the Directory**: Workspaces are specific to the working directory of your Terraform configuration.

### Example of Using `terraform.workspace` in Variables:

You can use `terraform.workspace` to adjust behavior based on the current workspace:

```hcl
variable "instance_count" {
  default = {
    default = 1
    dev     = 1
    prod    = 3
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "my_instance" {
  count         = var.instance_count[terraform.workspace]
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "${terraform.workspace}-instance"
  }
}
```

This example uses `terraform.workspace` to adjust the number of instances based on the current workspace (`dev` or `prod`).

# Terraform State file

https://jhooq.com/terraform-manage-state/

The **Terraform state file** is a critical component of Terraform's infrastructure management. It tracks the current state of your infrastructure and is used by Terraform to plan, apply, and manage resources. Here's an overview of what the state file is and how you can manage it effectively:

### 1. **What is the Terraform State File?**

- The state file is a JSON-formatted file that records the current state of your infrastructure. By default, itâ€™s stored locally as `terraform.tfstate`.
- It serves as the "source of truth" for Terraform, helping it understand what infrastructure exists, what resources have been applied, and how they relate to each other.
- Terraform uses the state file to compare the desired configuration (in your `.tf` files) with the actual state of the infrastructure (stored in `terraform.tfstate`), allowing it to generate a plan to apply changes.

### 2. **Key Details Stored in the State File:**

- Resource names and types.
- Metadata (like IDs, IP addresses) of resources that have been created.
- Dependencies between resources.
- Output values defined in your Terraform configuration.
- Sensitive information (such as passwords and access keys, unless encrypted).

### 3. **State File Location:**

- By default, the state file is stored locally as `terraform.tfstate`.
- In a team setting or for larger projects, it's recommended to store the state file remotely (e.g., in AWS S3, Terraform Cloud, or Azure Blob Storage) to ensure consistency and allow collaboration across multiple users.

### 4. **State File Management Operations:**

#### a. **Local State Management:**

- Terraform automatically manages the state file in the directory where the `terraform` commands are run.
- Local state files are useful for small projects or individual work, but can cause issues in collaborative environments because the state file can become out of sync if multiple users modify the infrastructure.

#### b. **Remote State Management:**

- For larger teams or multi-environment setups, it's important to store the state remotely to avoid conflicts.
- Remote state storage can be done in:
  - **AWS S3** (with optional DynamoDB for state locking)
  - **Terraform Cloud** or **Terraform Enterprise**
  - **Azure Blob Storage**
  - **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**

Example of configuring remote state in **AWS S3**:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "my-terraform-state-bucket"
    key    = "path/to/my-state-file"
    region = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-lock-table"  # For state locking
  }
}
```

#### c. **State Locking**:

- When multiple people or systems interact with Terraform simultaneously, thereâ€™s a risk of state corruption.
- **State locking** prevents this by ensuring that only one process can modify the state file at a time. Many remote backends (e.g., AWS S3 + DynamoDB, Terraform Cloud) support state locking.

#### d. **State File Commands:**

- **terraform state list**: Lists all the resources in the current state file.
- **terraform state show <resource>**: Shows the details of a specific resource in the state file.
- **terraform state pull**: Retrieves the current state file from the backend.
- **terraform state push**: Uploads a local state file to the configured remote backend.
- **terraform state mv <src> <dst>**: Moves a resource in the state file to a different resource name.
- **terraform state rm <resource>**: Removes a resource from the state file without destroying the resource in the real infrastructure.
- **terraform state import**: Imports an existing resource from your infrastructure into the Terraform state file.

#### e. **State File Migration**:

If you need to move the state file from local storage to remote storage (or between remote backends), you can use the following steps:

1.  **Initialize the new backend**: Update your `terraform { backend { ... } }` block in the configuration.
2.  Run `terraform init` to initialize the new backend.
3.  Terraform will offer to migrate the existing state file to the new backend automatically.

#### f. **State File Locking**:

- Locking prevents simultaneous write operations on the state file to avoid corruption.
- Most remote backends (such as AWS S3 with DynamoDB, Terraform Cloud) offer state file locking. Always enable locking in collaborative environments.

### 5. **Best Practices for Managing Terraform State:**

- **Use Remote State for Collaboration**: If multiple team members are working on the same Terraform project, use remote state storage (e.g., S3, Terraform Cloud) to ensure consistency and prevent conflicts.
- **Secure Sensitive Information**: The state file often contains sensitive information such as secrets, passwords, and keys. Use encrypted storage for remote state (such as S3 bucket with encryption enabled) or a tool like **Vault** for secure secret management.

- **State Backups**: Regularly back up your state file. Most remote state backends support versioning, but if youâ€™re using local state, create regular backups manually.

- **State Locking**: Enable state locking to prevent multiple users or processes from working on the same state file simultaneously.

- **Manage Drift**: Regularly check for drift between the state file and the actual infrastructure using `terraform plan`.

- **Minimize Direct Edits**: Avoid manually editing the state file unless absolutely necessary, as incorrect changes can lead to inconsistencies.

---

### Example of Remote State with AWS S3:

Hereâ€™s an example of using AWS S3 to store the state file with state locking via DynamoDB:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state-bucket"
    key            = "path/to/my/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-lock-table"  # Optional: For state locking
    encrypt        = true
  }
}
```

### Conclusion:

Terraform state management is crucial for tracking your infrastructure. Remote state storage and locking mechanisms are best practices for preventing conflicts and ensuring collaboration. Regular maintenance, such as backups and minimizing manual state edits, will help you avoid issues.

# Deploy using terraform on AWS lambda

### Create a lambda function

### In terraform ${path.module} is the current directory.

resource "aws_lambda_function" "terraform_lambda_func" {
filename = "${path.module}/python/hello-python.zip"
function_name = "Jhooq-Lambda-Function"
role = aws_iam_role.lambda_role.arn
handler = "hello-python.lambda_handler"
runtime = "python3.8"
depends_on = [aws_iam_role_policy_attachment.attach_iam_policy_to_iam_role]
}

To configure AWS credentials for use with Terraform (or any AWS CLI tool), you need to set up your AWS access and secret keys. Here are the steps to do this on your local machine:

# Steps to Configure AWS Credentials

#### 1. **Install AWS CLI (if not already installed)**

If you haven't already installed the AWS CLI, follow these steps based on your OS:

- **Windows**: Download the installer from [AWS CLI official page](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) or use `choco` (if you have Chocolatey):

  ```bash
  choco install awscli
  ```

- **macOS**: You can install it using `brew`:

  ```bash
  brew install awscli
  ```

- **Linux**: Use `apt` or `yum` based on your distribution:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install awscli
  ```

Verify the installation:

```bash
aws --version
```

#### 2. **Obtain AWS Access and Secret Keys**

You need your AWS **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**. These can be generated from the AWS Management Console.

1. **Log in to the AWS Console**.
2. Navigate to **IAM** (Identity and Access Management).
3. In the left-hand navigation pane, click on **Users**.
4. Select your username.
5. Go to the **Security credentials** tab and click on **Create access key**.
6. Copy the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**.

#### 3. **Configure AWS CLI with your credentials**

Once you have the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**, you can configure them using the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws configure
```

Youâ€™ll be prompted to enter the following details:

```bash
AWS Access Key ID [None]: YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
Default region name [None]: YOUR_DEFAULT_REGION (e.g., us-east-1)
Default output format [None]: json
```

- **Access Key ID**: Enter the Access Key ID you copied from the AWS console.
- **Secret Access Key**: Enter the Secret Access Key.
- **Default region**: Enter the region you want to work in (e.g., `us-east-1`, `eu-central-1`).
- **Output format**: You can set this to `json`, `text`, or `table`. `json` is commonly used.

This will create and store your credentials in `~/.aws/credentials` (Linux/macOS) or `C:\Users\<your-user>\.aws\credentials` (Windows).

#### 4. **Verify the Configuration**

Run the following command to verify that your credentials are configured correctly:

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

This will return details about your AWS account, confirming that your credentials are correctly set up:

```json
{
  "UserId": "AIDXXXXXX",
  "Account": "123456789012",
  "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/YourUserName"
}
```

#### 5. **Use with Terraform**

Once your credentials are configured using the AWS CLI, Terraform will automatically use them when you run `terraform init`, `terraform apply`, or any other Terraform command that interacts with AWS.

You donâ€™t need to hard-code the credentials in your Terraform configuration. Instead, Terraform will look for the credentials in the following locations (in order of priority):

1. Environment variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`).
2. Shared credentials file (`~/.aws/credentials`).
3. IAM role credentials (if running within an AWS EC2 instance).

### Optionally: Set AWS Credentials as Environment Variables

Alternatively, you can also export the AWS credentials as environment variables (useful for scripts or CI pipelines):

- **Windows (PowerShell)**:

  ```bash
  $env:AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
  $env:AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
  ```

- **Linux/macOS**:

  ```bash
  export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
  export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
  ```

### Conclusion

By following the steps above, youâ€™ll configure AWS credentials on your machine using either the AWS CLI configuration or environment variables. Once configured, you can use Terraform to provision and manage AWS resources without having to hard-code credentials into your scripts.
