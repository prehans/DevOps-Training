- **Embedded Systems**: Linux is widely used in embedded systems, such as routers, smart TVs, and other IoT devices.
- **Desktops**: While less common than Windows or macOS, Linux is used on desktops by those who prefer its customizability and performance.

## About Virtual Box

VirtualBox is a free and open-source virtualization software developed by Oracle. It allows users to run multiple operating systems simultaneously on a single physical machine, creating virtual machines (VMs) that behave as if they were separate computers. VirtualBox is widely used for testing, development, and running applications in different environments without needing separate physical hardware.

### Key Features of VirtualBox:

1. **Cross-Platform Support**: VirtualBox runs on various host operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and Solaris. This makes it versatile for users working in different environments.

2. **Wide Range of Guest OS Support**: VirtualBox supports a broad range of guest operating systems, including various versions of Windows, Linux, macOS (with some restrictions), Solaris, and even older systems like DOS.

3. **Snapshots**: VirtualBox allows users to take snapshots of the current state of a virtual machine. This feature is useful for testing and development, as it allows users to revert to a previous state if something goes wrong.

4. **Seamless Mode**: This feature allows applications from the guest OS to appear on the host OS's desktop as if they were native applications. It provides an integrated experience for users running multiple OS environments.

5. **Shared Folders and Clipboard**: VirtualBox enables easy sharing of files and clipboard content between the host and guest operating systems, making it easier to move data between environments.

6. **Virtual Networking**: VirtualBox provides robust networking features, allowing VMs to connect to the internet, communicate with each other, and access the host network. Users can configure network settings to simulate different network environments.

7. **USB Device Support**: VirtualBox allows guest OSs to access USB devices connected to the host machine, such as printers, storage devices, and other peripherals.

8. **3D Graphics Acceleration**: VirtualBox supports 3D graphics acceleration for guest OSs, improving the performance of graphical applications running in virtual machines.

9. **Command Line Interface (CLI) and API**: Advanced users can manage VirtualBox through its command-line interface or use its API for scripting and automation.

### Common Uses of VirtualBox:

- **Software Testing**: Developers and testers use VirtualBox to run different operating systems and software configurations to ensure compatibility and performance.
- **Learning and Experimentation**: Users can safely experiment with new operating systems, software, or configurations without affecting their primary system.
- **Development**: VirtualBox is often used to create isolated development environments, enabling developers to work on projects in different OS environments.
- **Legacy Software**: VirtualBox allows users to run older operating systems or software that may not be compatible with modern hardware.

In virtualization environments like VirtualBox, network adapters are used to manage how virtual machines (VMs) connect to networks, including how they communicate with the host system, other VMs, and external networks. Two common network adapter types are **Host-Only Adapter** and **Bridged Adapter**. Here's how they differ:

### Host-Only Adapter

A **Host-Only Adapter** is a type of network connection in VirtualBox that creates a private network between the host machine and the virtual machine(s). This network is isolated from the external network (like the internet) and can only be accessed by the host and the VMs that are configured to use the host-only network.

#### Characteristics:

- **Private Network**: The VM and the host machine can communicate with each other, but the VM cannot access external networks or the internet.
- **Isolated**: The network is isolated, meaning VMs on a host-only network cannot communicate with the outside world, but they can communicate with the host and other VMs on the same host-only network.
- **Use Cases**: Host-Only Adapters are often used for testing or when you want to isolate the VM from the internet while still allowing communication between the VM and the host for tasks like file sharing, local development, or running network simulations.

### Bridged Adapter

A **Bridged Adapter** allows the VM to connect to the same network as the host machine, effectively making the VM appear as another machine on the same physical network. This setup "bridges" the virtual network adapter in the VM to the host's physical network adapter.

#### Characteristics:

- **Same Network as Host**: The VM is connected directly to the host's network, meaning it can communicate with other devices on the network, access the internet, and be accessed by other devices on the network as if it were a physical machine.
- **IP Address**: The VM will get its own IP address from the network’s DHCP server, just like any other device on the network.
- **Use Cases**: Bridged Adapters are used when you want the VM to have full access to the network, such as for network services, server deployment, or when you need the VM to be accessible from other devices on the network.

### Comparison:

- **Host-Only Adapter**:

  - **Visibility**: VMs are visible only to the host and other VMs using the host-only network.
  - **External Access**: No access to the internet or external network.
  - **IP Address**: IP addresses are typically assigned from a private IP range defined by VirtualBox.

- **Bridged Adapter**:
  - **Visibility**: VMs are visible on the same network as the host and can interact with other devices on that network.
  - **External Access**: Full access to the internet and the local network.
  - **IP Address**: IP address is assigned by the network’s DHCP server, making it similar to any other device on the network.

### Choosing Between Host-Only and Bridged Adapter:

- **Use Host-Only Adapter** if you want to create a secure, isolated network where VMs can only communicate with each other and the host machine.
- **Use Bridged Adapter** if you need the VM to be part of the same network as the host, allowing it to communicate with other network devices and access the internet.

These adapters can be configured through the network settings of the VM in VirtualBox, depending on the specific networking requirements of your virtual environment.

# Important

Host only adapter = allows communication between your PC and the virtual machine

Bridge adapter = allows communication between your PC and VM plus allows communication to the internet.

These commands are essential for navigating and managing files in the Linux file system. With these tools, you can move through directories, view and manipulate files, and gather information about your system’s storage.

When you list files and directories in Linux using the `ls -l` command, you get detailed information about each item. The output provides several attributes for each file or directory. Here’s what each part of the output means:

### Example of `ls -l` Output

```bash
$ ls -l
-rw-r--r--  1 user group  4096 Aug 24 10:00 example.txt
drwxr-xr-x  2 user group  4096 Aug 24 09:30 example_directory
```

### Explanation of Attributes

1. **File Type and Permissions (`-rw-r--r--`)**

   - The first character indicates the type of the file:

     - `-`: Regular file
     - `d`: Directory
     - `l`: Symbolic link
     - `b`: Block device
     - `c`: Character device
     - `p`: Named pipe (FIFO)
     - `s`: Socket

   - The next nine characters show the file's permissions, grouped into three sets:

     - **Owner Permissions** (first three characters): `rw-`
     - **Group Permissions** (middle three characters): `r--`
     - **Other Permissions** (last three characters): `r--`

   - **Permission Codes**:

     - `r`: Read permission
     - `w`: Write permission
     - `x`: Execute permission
     - `-`: No permission

   - Example:
     - `-rw-r--r--`: A regular file where the owner can read and write, the group can read, and others can read.

2. **Link Count (`1`)**

   - This number indicates the number of hard links to the file or the number of subdirectories in a directory.
   - Example:
     - `1` means there is one link (or no subdirectories if it’s a directory).

3. **Owner (`user`)**

   - The username of the owner of the file or directory.
   - Example:
     - `user` indicates that the file is owned by the user named "user."

4. **Group (`group`)**

   - The group that owns the file or directory.
   - Example:
     - `group` indicates that the file belongs to the group named "group."

5. **File Size (`4096`)**

   - The size of the file in bytes.
   - For directories, this represents the amount of space taken by the directory's structure, not the size of the contents.
   - Example:
     - `4096` bytes (4 KB).

6. **Last Modified Date and Time (`Aug 24 10:00`)**

   - The date and time when the file or directory was last modified.
   - Example:
     - `Aug 24 10:00` indicates the file was last modified on August 24th at 10:00 AM.

7. **File Name (`example.txt`)**
   - The name of the file or directory.
   - Example:
     - `example.txt` is the name of the file.

### Full Example Breakdown

```bash
drwxr-xr-x  2 user group  4096 Aug 24 09:30 example_directory
```

- **`d`**: This is a directory.
- **`rwxr-xr-x`**: The owner has read, write, and execute permissions; the group and others have read and execute permissions.
- **`2`**: There are two links (likely the directory itself and one subdirectory or a parent link).
- **`user`**: Owned by the user named "user."
- **`group`**: Owned by the group named "group."
- **`4096`**: The directory takes up 4096 bytes.
- **`Aug 24 09:30`**: Last modified on August 24th at 09:30 AM.
- **`example_directory`**: The directory name is "example_directory."

### Summary of Attributes

- **File Type and Permissions**: Indicate whether it's a file, directory, or other, and what operations (read, write, execute) are allowed.
- **Link Count**: Number of hard links to the file or subdirectories in a directory.
- **Owner**: User who owns the file.
- **Group**: Group that owns the file.
- **File Size**: Size of the file in bytes.
- **Last Modified Date and Time**: When the file was last modified.
- **File Name**: The name of the file or directory.

This detailed listing helps you understand not just the contents of a directory, but also the properties and permissions associated with each item.

Creating files and directories in Linux is straightforward using command-line tools. Below are the common commands to create files and directories:

### Creating Files

1. **`touch` Command**

   - The `touch` command creates an empty file or updates the timestamp of an existing file.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     touch filename.txt
     ```
   - **Creating Multiple Files**:
     ```bash
     touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
     ```

2. **`echo` Command**

   - The `echo` command prints text to the terminal, and you can redirect its output to create a file with content.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     echo "This is some text" > filename.txt
     ```
   - **Note**: The `>` operator overwrites the file if it exists. To append text to an existing file, use `>>`:
     ```bash
     echo "This is additional text" >> filename.txt
     ```

3. **`cat` Command**

   - The `cat` command can also be used to create a file with content by redirecting its output.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     cat > filename.txt
     ```
     After running this command, you can type the content of the file. To finish and save, press `Ctrl+D`.

4. **`nano` or `vi`/`vim` Editors**
   - You can create and edit a file using text editors like `nano`, `vi`, or `vim`.
   - Example with `nano`:
     ```bash
     nano filename.txt
     ```
   - Example with `vi` or `vim`:
     ```bash
     vi filename.txt
     ```

### Creating Directories

1. **`mkdir` Command**
   - The `mkdir` command creates one or more directories.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     mkdir new_directory
     ```
   - **Creating Multiple Directories**:
     ```bash
     mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3
     ```
   - **Creating Parent Directories**:
     - If you want to create a nested directory structure and the parent directories do not exist, use the `-p` option.
     - Example:
       ```bash
       mkdir -p /path/to/new_directory
       ```

### Verifying File and Directory Creation

- **List Files and Directories**:
  - After creating files or directories, you can use the `ls` command to verify their creation.
  - Example:
    ```bash
    ls -l
    ```

### Summary

- **Creating Files**:
  - `touch filename.txt`: Creates an empty file.
  - `echo "text" > filename.txt`: Creates a file with the specified text.
  - `cat > filename.txt`: Creates a file with content entered interactively.
  - `nano filename.txt`: Creates and edits a file using the `nano` editor.
- **Creating Directories**:
  - `mkdir directory_name`: Creates a directory.
  - `mkdir -p /path/to/new_directory`: Creates nested directories, creating parent directories if necessary.

These commands allow you to easily create and manage files and directories within the Linux file system.

# Pipes

In Linux and other Unix-like operating systems, **pipes** are a powerful feature that allows you to direct the output of one command into the input of another. This enables you to chain together commands to perform complex tasks efficiently.

### How Pipes Work

- **Basic Syntax**:
  - The pipe symbol `|` is used to create a pipe between two commands.
  - The general syntax is:
    ```bash
    command1 | command2
    ```
  - Here, `command1` produces output, and `command2` takes this output as its input.

### Examples of Pipes

1. **Viewing a Long File with `less`**

   - If a file has too many lines to fit on the screen, you can use `cat` to display the contents and pipe it to `less` for easier viewing:
   - Example:
     ```bash
     cat largefile.txt | less
     ```
   - This command shows the content of `largefile.txt` one screen at a time.

2. **Finding and Counting Lines with `grep` and `wc`**

   - Suppose you want to find the number of lines in a file that contain a specific word:
   - Example:
     ```bash
     grep "word" filename.txt | wc -l
     ```
   - Here, `grep` searches for "word" in `filename.txt`, and `wc -l` counts the number of matching lines.

3. **Sorting and Displaying Unique Lines**

   - If you want to sort the contents of a file and then display only unique lines:
   - Example:
     ```bash
     sort filename.txt | uniq
     ```
   - This command sorts the file and then removes any duplicate lines.

4. **Filtering Output with `grep`**

   - You can filter the output of a command using `grep` to display only lines that match a pattern:
   - Example:
     ```bash
     ls -l | grep "^d"
     ```
   - This command lists all items in the current directory and then filters the output to show only directories (lines starting with "d").

5. **Combining `dmesg` and `tail`**
   - If you want to see the last 10 messages from the kernel ring buffer:
   - Example:
     ```bash
     dmesg | tail
     ```
   - This command shows the most recent kernel messages.

### Summary of Common Commands Used with Pipes

- **`cat`**: Concatenates and displays file content.
- **`grep`**: Searches for a pattern within text.
- **`sort`**: Sorts lines of text.
- **`uniq`**: Filters out repeated lines.
- **`wc`**: Counts words, lines, and characters.

- **`tail`**: Displays the last few lines of a file.

### Summary

Pipes allow you to connect multiple commands together, where the output of one command becomes the input for the next. This enables you to perform more complex tasks by combining simple commands, making pipes a fundamental tool in Linux for efficient command-line operations.

In Linux, file permissions control who can read, write, or execute a file or directory. Understanding and managing file permissions is crucial for system security and proper file management.

### File Permission Basics

Each file and directory in Linux has three types of permissions for three different categories of users:

1. **User (Owner)**: The owner of the file.
2. **Group**: A group of users who share permissions.
3. **Other (World)**: All other users.

### Types of Permissions

Each of these categories can have three types of permissions:

- **Read (`r`)**: Allows reading or viewing the contents of the file or directory.
- **Write (`w`)**: Allows modifying or deleting the contents of the file or directory.
- **Execute (`x`)**: Allows executing the file if it is a script or program, or entering the directory to access its contents.

### Representing Permissions

Permissions are represented in two main ways:

1. **Symbolic Notation**:

   - Example: `-rwxr-xr--`
   - The string is divided into four parts:
     - **File Type**: The first character indicates the file type:
       - `-`: Regular file
       - `d`: Directory
       - `l`: Symbolic link
     - **User (Owner) Permissions**: The next three characters (`rwx`) show the permissions for the file's owner.
     - **Group Permissions**: The next three characters (`r-x`) show the permissions for the group.
     - **Other Permissions**: The last three characters (`r--`) show the permissions for others.

2. **Numeric (Octal) Notation**:

   - Example: `755`
   - Each digit represents the permissions for the user, group, and others, respectively:

     - **4**: Read (`r`)
     - **2**: Write (`w`)
     - **1**: Execute (`x`)
     - These are summed up to form a number (e.g., `7` for `rwx`).

   - **Examples**:

     - `7` (`rwx`): Read, write, and execute (4+2+1).
     - `5` (`r-x`): Read and execute (4+1).
     - `0` (`---`): No permissions.

   - Example Breakdown:
     - `755` means:
       - **Owner**: `7` (`rwx`)
       - **Group**: `5` (`r-x`)
       - **Other**: `5` (`r-x`)

### Viewing Permissions

To view file permissions, use the `ls -l` command:

```bash
ls -l
```

Example output:

```bash
-rwxr-xr--  1 user group  4096 Aug 24 10:00 example.txt
```

### Changing Permissions

1. **`chmod` Command**: Change file permissions using symbolic or numeric notation.

   - **Using Symbolic Notation**:

     ```bash
     chmod u+x filename   # Adds execute permission to the owner
     chmod g-w filename   # Removes write permission from the group
     chmod o+r filename   # Adds read permission to others
     chmod u=rw, g=r, o=r filename # Sets specific permissions
     ```

   - **Using Numeric Notation**:
     ```bash
     chmod 755 filename   # Sets the permissions to rwxr-xr-x
     chmod 644 filename   # Sets the permissions to rw-r--r--
     ```

2. **`chown` Command**: Change the owner of a file or directory.

   ```bash
   chown new_owner filename
   chown new_owner:new_group filename
   ```

3. **`chgrp` Command**: Change the group of a file or directory.
   ```bash
   chgrp new_group filename
   ```

### Examples

- **Make a Script Executable**:

  ```bash
  chmod +x script.sh
  ```

- **Set Permissions to Read and Write for Owner, Read for Group, and None for Others**:

  ```bash
  chmod 640 filename.txt
  ```

- **Change Ownership of a File**:
  ```bash
  chown user:group filename.txt
  ```

### Summary

- **File Permissions** control access to files and directories.
- **Permissions** are divided into read (`r`), write (`w`), and execute (`x`), applied to the user, group, and others.
- **`chmod`** is used to change permissions, either symbolically or numerically.
- **`chown`** and **`chgrp`** manage ownership and group association, respectively.

Understanding and managing file permissions is key to maintaining the security and proper functioning of a Linux system.

In Linux, file ownership is managed through two main commands: `chown` and `chgrp`.

### 1. **`chown` Command** (Change Ownership)

The `chown` command is used to change the ownership of a file or directory. It can change both the owner (user) and the group associated with the file.

#### **Basic Syntax:**

```bash
chown [OPTION]... [OWNER][:[GROUP]] FILE...
```

- **`OWNER`**: The new owner (user) of the file.
- **`GROUP`**: The new group of the file. This is optional.
- **`FILE`**: The file or directory whose ownership you want to change.

#### **Examples:**

1. **Change the Owner of a File:**

   - This command changes the owner of `file.txt` to `new_user`.

   ```bash
   chown new_user file.txt
   ```

2. **Change Both the Owner and Group:**

   - This command changes the owner of `file.txt` to `new_user` and the group to `new_group`.

   ```bash
   chown new_user:new_group file.txt
   ```

3. **Change Only the Group:**

   - If you only want to change the group, you can use:

   ```bash
   chown :new_group file.txt
   ```

4. **Change Ownership Recursively:**
   - To change ownership for a directory and all its contents, use the `-R` option:
   ```bash
   chown -R new_user:new_group directory_name/
   ```

### 2. **`chgrp` Command** (Change Group)

The `chgrp` command is used to change the group ownership of a file or directory.

#### **Basic Syntax:**

```bash
chgrp [OPTION]... GROUP FILE...
```

- **`GROUP`**: The new group of the file.
- **`FILE`**: The file or directory whose group you want to change.

#### **Examples:**

1. **Change the Group of a File:**

   - This command changes the group of `file.txt` to `new_group`.

   ```bash
   chgrp new_group file.txt
   ```

2. **Change Group Ownership Recursively:**
   - To change the group for a directory and all its contents, use the `-R` option:
   ```bash
   chgrp -R new_group directory_name/
   ```

### Viewing File Ownership

To view the current owner and group of a file or directory, use the `ls -l` command:

```bash
ls -l filename
```

Example output:

```bash
-rw-r--r-- 1 user group  4096 Aug 24 10:00 filename.txt
```

In this example, `user` is the owner and `group` is the group associated with the file.

### Summary

- **`chown`**: Used to change the owner and optionally the group of a file or directory.
- **`chgrp`**: Used to change the group of a file or directory.
- **`-R` option**: Used with `chown` or `chgrp` to apply changes recursively to all files and subdirectories within a directory.

These commands are essential for managing file ownership and ensuring proper access control in a Linux environment.

# Adding text to a file

In Linux, there are several ways to add text to a file. Here are some common methods:

### 1. **Using `echo` Command**

You can use the `echo` command to append text to a file.

#### **Append Text to a File:**

```bash
echo "This is the text" >> filename.txt
```

- **`>>`**: Appends the text to the end of the file. If the file doesn't exist, it will create it.

#### **Overwrite Text in a File:**

```bash
echo "This will overwrite the file" > filename.txt
```

- **`>`**: Overwrites the file with the new content. If the file doesn't exist, it will create it.

### 2. **Using `cat` Command**

The `cat` command can also be used to add text to a file.

#### **Append Text:**

```bash
cat >> filename.txt
```

- After running this command, you can type the text you want to add. Press `Ctrl + D` to save and exit.

#### **Overwrite File:**

```bash
cat > filename.txt
```

- This will overwrite the file with the text you enter.

### 3. **Using Text Editors**

You can also use text editors to add or modify text in a file.

#### **Using `nano`:**

```bash
nano filename.txt
```

- Opens the file in the `nano` editor. You can add, modify, or delete text as needed. Press `Ctrl + O` to save, and `Ctrl + X` to exit.

#### **Using `vi` or `vim`:**

```bash
vi filename.txt
```

- Opens the file in `vi` or `vim` editor. Press `i` to enter insert mode, add your text, and then press `Esc`. To save and exit, type `:wq` and press `Enter`.

### 4. **Using `printf` Command**

The `printf` command can be used similarly to `echo` but provides more formatting options.

#### **Append Text:**

```bash
printf "This is the text\n" >> filename.txt
```

- Appends the text with a newline to the file.

#### **Overwrite Text:**

```bash
printf "This will overwrite the file\n" > filename.txt
```

- Overwrites the file with the new content.

#### print the details of a file

we can use

```bash
 cat filename
```

### Summary

- **`echo`**: Quick and easy for simple text additions.
- **`cat`**: Useful for appending or overwriting directly from the terminal.
- **Text Editors (`nano`, `vi`)**: Best for editing larger or more complex files.
- **`printf`**: Offers more control over text formatting than `echo`.

Choose the method that best suits your needs, whether you're making a quick addition or editing a file more extensively.

# Linux File editor (vi)

The `vi` editor is a powerful and widely used text editor in Linux and Unix systems. It’s a modal editor, meaning it operates in different modes, each with its own specific purpose. Here's a basic guide to using `vi`.

### Opening a File with `vi`

To open a file in `vi`, type the following command:

```bash
vi file_name
```

If the file does not exist, `vi` will create it when you save your changes.

### Modes in `vi`

`vi` operates in several modes, but the most commonly used are:

1. **Normal Mode**: This is the default mode. In this mode, you can move around the file and execute commands. You cannot insert or delete text directly in this mode.

2. **Insert Mode**: This mode is for editing text. You can enter this mode by pressing `i` (insert), `a` (append), or `o` (open a new line).

3. **Command Mode**: This mode is for saving your work, exiting the editor, searching, and other tasks. You enter command mode from normal mode by typing `:` (colon).

### Basic Commands

#### Switching Modes

- **Normal Mode to Insert Mode**:
  - `i`: Insert text at the cursor position.
  - `a`: Append text after the cursor.
  - `o`: Open a new line below the current line.
- **Insert Mode to Normal Mode**:

  - Press `Esc` to return to Normal Mode.

- **Normal Mode to Command Mode**:
  - Press `:` to enter Command Mode from Normal Mode.

#### Saving and Exiting

- **Save changes and exit**:

  ```bash
  :wq
  ```

  - `:w` (write) saves the changes, and `q` (quit) exits the editor.

- **Exit without saving**:

  ```bash
  :q!
  ```

  - `q!` forces `vi` to quit without saving changes.

- **Save changes without exiting**:
  ```bash
  :w
  ```
  - Writes (saves) changes to the file but keeps `vi` open.

#### Navigating in Normal Mode

In Linux, **processes** and **scheduling** are fundamental concepts that manage the execution of programs and the allocation of system resources. Here's an overview:

### 1. Processes in Linux

A **process** is an instance of a program that is being executed. Each process in Linux has a unique Process ID (PID) and can be in different states such as running, sleeping, stopped, or zombie.

#### Types of Processes:

- **Foreground Processes**: Processes that run directly in the terminal and take user input.
- **Background Processes**: Processes that run without user interaction, often in the background.

#### Key Commands to Manage Processes:

- **`ps`**: Lists the currently running processes.
  - Example: `ps aux` shows detailed information about all processes.
- **`top` or `htop`**: Provides a dynamic, real-time view of running processes.
- **`kill`**: Terminates a process by sending a signal.
  - Example: `kill 1234` kills the process with PID 1234.
- **`killall`**: Kills all processes with a specific name.
  - Example: `killall firefox` kills all Firefox processes.
- **`bg`**: Resumes a suspended job in the background.
  - Example: `bg %1` resumes job 1 in the background.
- **`fg`**: Brings a background process to the foreground.
  - Example: `fg %1` brings job 1 to the foreground.
- **`nice` and `renice`**: Adjust the priority of a process.
  - Example: `nice -n 10 ./script.sh` runs `script.sh` with a lower priority.
  - Example: `renice +5 1234` changes the priority of process 1234.

### 2. Scheduling in Linux

**Scheduling** refers to how the system decides which processes should run at any given time. The Linux kernel uses various scheduling algorithms to manage process execution and ensure efficient use of CPU resources.

#### Key Concepts:

- **Scheduler**: The component of the kernel that decides which process runs next.
- **Context Switching**: The process of saving the state of a currently running process and loading the state of another process.
- **Time Slice**: The amount of time a process is allowed to run before the scheduler switches to another process.
- **Scheduling Policies**: Linux supports several scheduling policies that determine how processes are prioritized.

#### Scheduling Policies:

- **SCHED_OTHER**: The default time-sharing policy for most processes.
- **SCHED_FIFO**: First-in, first-out real-time scheduling, where processes run until they finish or are blocked.
- **SCHED_RR**: Round-robin real-time scheduling, similar to FIFO but with a time quantum.
- **SCHED_BATCH**: Suitable for processes that are not interactive and can run in the background.
- **SCHED_IDLE**: For processes that should only run when the system is idle.

#### Controlling Process Scheduling:

- **`nice`**: Launches a process with a specific priority.
- **`renice`**: Alters the priority of an existing process.
- **`chrt`**: Manipulates the real-time attributes of a process.
  - Example: `chrt -r 20 ./script.sh` runs `script.sh` with a real-time priority of 20.

#### Checking and Modifying Scheduling:

- **`ps -eo pid,comm,pri,nice`**: Displays the priority and nice value of processes.
- **`chrt -p <PID>`**: Displays the real-time attributes of a given process.

### 3. Monitoring Processes and Scheduling

- **`top`/`htop`**: These commands show the processes in real-time, including their CPU usage, memory usage, and other vital statistics.
- **`vmstat`**: Reports information about processes, memory, paging, block IO, traps, and CPU activity.

### Summary

- **Processes**: Instances of programs that are currently executing, each identified by a unique PID. Managed using commands like `ps`, `kill`, `bg`, and `fg`.
- **Scheduling**: The mechanism by which the Linux kernel decides which process to execute next, ensuring efficient use of the CPU. Can be influenced using `nice`, `renice`, and `chrt`.

Understanding processes and scheduling is crucial for managing system performance, ensuring that critical tasks receive the necessary resources while non-essential tasks are appropriately managed.

In Linux, a **daemon** is a background process that runs independently of user interaction. Daemons typically start when the system boots and continue running to perform specific tasks or services. They are often used for managing system operations like network services, hardware activity, or scheduled tasks.

### Key Characteristics of Daemons:

- **Background Operation**: Daemons run in the background, meaning they do not have a controlling terminal and do not require user interaction.
- **Autonomous**: They often start automatically during system boot and run continuously without user input.
- **Naming Convention**: Daemon names often end with the letter "d" (e.g., `sshd` for the SSH daemon, `httpd` for the Apache HTTP Server daemon).
- **System Services**: Daemons usually provide services that are critical to the functioning of the system or network, such as managing connections, logging, or scheduling tasks.

### Examples of Common Daemons:

- **`sshd`**: Manages incoming SSH connections, allowing remote login to the system.
- **`httpd`**: The Apache HTTP Server daemon, which serves web pages over the network.
- **`cron`**: Schedules and runs tasks at specified times or intervals.
- **`syslogd`**: Collects and logs system messages.
- **`inetd`** or **`xinetd`**: Manages network connections for various services.

### Starting, Stopping, and Managing Daemons:

In most Linux distributions, daemons are managed by an **init system** such as `systemd`, `SysVinit`, or `Upstart`. Here’s how you can interact with daemons using `systemd`, which is the most common init system in modern Linux distributions:

- **Start a Daemon**:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start <daemon_name>
  ```

  Example: To start the SSH daemon:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start sshd
  ```

- **Stop a Daemon**:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl stop <daemon_name>
  ```

  Example: To stop the SSH daemon:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl stop sshd
  ```

- **Enable a Daemon to Start at Boot**:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl enable <daemon_name>
  ```

  Example: To ensure the SSH daemon starts at boot:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl enable sshd
  ```

- **Disable a Daemon**:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl disable <daemon_name>
  ```

  Example: To disable the SSH daemon from starting at boot:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl disable sshd
  ```

- **Check the Status of a Daemon**:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status <daemon_name>
  ```
  Example: To check the status of the SSH daemon:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status sshd

### Creating a Custom Daemon

If you need to create a custom daemon, you can write a shell script or program that performs a specific task, and then configure it to run in the background and start automatically at boot.

Basic steps to create a custom daemon:

1. **Write the Script**: Create a script that runs your task.
2. **Move the Script**: Place the script in `/usr/local/bin/` or another appropriate directory.
3. **Create a Service File**: For `systemd`, you would create a `.service` file in `/etc/systemd/system/`.
4. **Enable and Start the Daemon**: Use `systemctl` to enable and start your daemon.

### Summary

- **Daemon**: A background process that runs without user interaction, often starting at system boot and providing essential system services.
- **Common Daemons**: `sshd` (SSH), `httpd` (Apache), `cron` (task scheduling).
- **Management**: Daemons are typically managed via the `systemctl` command in `systemd`, allowing you to start, stop, enable, or disable them.

Daemons are essential for managing and maintaining various system functions and services, ensuring that they run smoothly and efficiently.

In Linux, **`crontab`** and **`at`** are two powerful utilities used for scheduling tasks, but they serve slightly different purposes:

### 1. `crontab`

**`crontab`** (cron table) is used to schedule repetitive tasks to run at specified intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly). The tasks are executed by the **cron daemon** (`crond`), which continuously runs in the background and checks the schedule.

#### Key Features:

- **Schedules repetitive tasks**: Ideal for tasks that need to run regularly, such as backups, updates, or clean-up scripts.
- **Flexible scheduling**: Allows for precise control over when tasks are executed, down to the minute.

#### Crontab Syntax:

A crontab entry consists of five time-and-date fields followed by the command to be executed:

```plaintext
* * * * * command-to-be-executed
| | | | |
| | | | +---- Day of the week (0 - 7) (Sunday = 0 or 7)
| | | +------ Month (1 - 12)
| | +-------- Day of the month (1 - 31)
| +---------- Hour (0 - 23)
+------------ Minute (0 - 59)
```

#### Example Crontab Entries:

- **Run a script every day at 2:30 AM:**
  ```bash
  30 2 * * * /path/to/script.sh
  ```
- **Run a command every Monday at 5:00 PM:**
  ```bash
  0 17 * * 1 /path/to/command
  ```
- **Run a backup at midnight on the 1st of every month:**
  ```bash
  0 0 1 * * /path/to/backup.sh
  ```

#### Managing Crontab:

- **View crontab entries for the current user:**
  ```bash
  crontab -l
  ```
- **Edit the crontab for the current user:**
  ```bash
  crontab -e
  ```
- **Remove all crontab entries for the current user:**
  ```bash
  crontab -r
  ```

### 2. `at`

**`at`** is used to schedule a one-time task for a specific time in the future. Unlike `crontab`, which is used for repetitive tasks, `at` is perfect for scheduling tasks that need to run just once.

#### Key Features:

- **Schedules one-time tasks**: Useful for tasks that need to be run once at a specific time, such as sending a reminder email or running a script later in the day.
- **Flexible time specification**: You can specify times like "now + 1 hour" or "midnight tomorrow."

#### Using `at`:

1. **Schedule a one-time task**:

   ```bash
   at 14:30
   ```

   This opens a prompt where you can type the command you want to execute at 2:30 PM.

2. **Example Usage**:

   ```bash
   at now + 1 hour
   at> /path/to/script.sh
   at> <EOT>  # Press Ctrl + D to save and exit
   ```

3. **List all scheduled `at` jobs**:

   ```bash
   atq
   ```

   This shows the list of all jobs scheduled with `at`.

4. **Remove a scheduled `at` job**:
   ```bash
   atrm <job_number>
   ```
   The `<job_number>` can be found using `atq`.

### Summary

- **`crontab`**: Used for scheduling recurring tasks. Ideal for jobs that need to be executed regularly, like daily backups or weekly reports.
- **`at`**: Used for scheduling one-time tasks. Perfect for tasks that need to run once at a specific future time, such as sending a notification or running a script.

Both tools are integral to task automation in Linux, helping users manage time-consuming tasks efficiently.

In Linux, a **daemon** is a background process that runs independently of user interaction. Daemons typically start when the system boots and continue running to perform specific tasks or services. They are often used for managing system operations like network services, hardware activity, or scheduled tasks.

### Key Characteristics of Daemons:

- **Background Operation**: Daemons run in the background, meaning they do not have a controlling terminal and do not require user interaction.
- **Autonomous**: They often start automatically during system boot and run continuously without user input.
- **Naming Convention**: Daemon names often end with the letter "d" (e.g., `sshd` for the SSH daemon, `httpd` for the Apache HTTP Server daemon).
- **System Services**: Daemons usually provide services that are critical to the functioning of the system or network, such as managing connections, logging, or scheduling tasks.

### Examples of Common Daemons:

- **`sshd`**: Manages incoming SSH connections, allowing remote login to the system.
- **`httpd`**: The Apache HTTP Server daemon, which serves web pages over the network.
- **`cron`**: Schedules and runs tasks at specified times or intervals.
- **`syslogd`**: Collects and logs system messages.
- **`inetd`** or **`xinetd`**: Manages network connections for various services.

### Starting, Stopping, and Managing Daemons:

In most Linux distributions, daemons are managed by an **init system** such as `systemd`, `SysVinit`, or `Upstart`. Here’s how you can interact with daemons using `systemd`, which is the most common init system in modern Linux distributions:

- **Start a Daemon**:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start <daemon_name>
  ```

  Example: To start the SSH daemon:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start sshd
  ```

- **Stop a Daemon**:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl stop <daemon_name>
  ```

  Example: To stop the SSH daemon:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl stop sshd
  ```

- **Enable a Daemon to Start at Boot**:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl enable <daemon_name>
  ```

  Example: To ensure the SSH daemon starts at boot:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl enable sshd
  ```

- **Disable a Daemon**:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl disable <daemon_name>
  ```

  Example: To disable the SSH daemon from starting at boot:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl disable sshd
  ```

- **Check the Status of a Daemon**:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status <daemon_name>
  ```
  Example: To check the status of the SSH daemon:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status sshd
  ```

### Creating a Custom Daemon

If you need to create a custom daemon, you can write a shell script or program that performs a specific task, and then configure it to run in the background and start automatically at boot.

Basic steps to create a custom daemon:

1. **Write the Script**: Create a script that runs your task.
2. **Move the Script**: Place the script in `/usr/local/bin/` or another appropriate directory.
3. **Create a Service File**: For `systemd`, you would create a `.service` file in `/etc/systemd/system/`.
4. **Enable and Start the Daemon**: Use `systemctl` to enable and start your daemon.

### Summary

- **Daemon**: A background process that runs without user interaction, often starting at system boot and providing essential system services.
- **Common Daemons**: `sshd` (SSH), `httpd` (Apache), `cron` (task scheduling).
- **Management**: Daemons are typically managed via the `systemctl` command in `systemd`, allowing you to start, stop, enable, or disable them.

Daemons are essential for managing and maintaining various system functions and services, ensuring that they run smoothly and efficiently.

# System Monitoring Command

# Shell Scripting

**Shell scripting** is a way to automate tasks in Linux (or other Unix-like systems) by writing a sequence of commands in a text file, known as a script. These scripts are executed by the shell, which is the command-line interpreter that provides a user interface to the operating system.

### What is a Shell?

- **Shell**: A shell is a program that interprets and executes commands typed by a user or written in a script. The most common shell in Linux is the **Bash** shell (`bash`).
- **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: The shell provides a command line where users can type commands to perform tasks like file manipulation, program execution, and system monitoring.

### What is Shell Scripting?

- **Shell Scripting**: It's the practice of writing a series of commands in a file (a script) that can be executed to perform complex or repetitive tasks automatically. This allows users to automate routine tasks, saving time and reducing the chance of errors.
- **Scripts**: Shell scripts are typically saved with a `.sh` extension, although this is not mandatory.

### Why Use Shell Scripting?

- **Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks, such as backups, file management, or system monitoring.
- **Simplification**: Combine multiple commands into a single script to simplify complex tasks.
- **Customization**: Create custom commands or workflows tailored to specific needs.
- **Efficiency**: Run a sequence of commands automatically without user intervention.

### Basic Components of a Shell Script

1. **Shebang (#!)**: The first line of a shell script usually starts with `#!/bin/bash`, which tells the system that the script should be run using the Bash shell.

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   ```

2. **Comments**: Lines starting with `#` are comments and are not executed. They are used to explain what the script does.

   ```bash
   # This is a comment
   ```

3. **Commands**: The core of a shell script is a series of commands that the shell will execute.

   ```bash
   echo "Hello, World!"
   ```

4. **Variables**: You can store data in variables and use them later in the script.

   ```bash
   NAME="John"
   echo "Hello, $NAME!"
   ```

5. **Control Structures**: Shell scripts can include loops (`for`, `while`), conditionals (`if`, `else`), and case statements to control the flow of the script.

   ```bash
   if [ "$NAME" == "John" ]; then
       echo "Welcome, John!"
   else
       echo "Who are you?"
   fi
   ```

6. **Functions**: You can define functions to group and reuse code.

   ```bash
   greet() {
       echo "Hello, $1!"
   }

   greet "Alice"
   greet "Bob"
   ```

### Creating and Running a Shell Script

1. **Create a Script File**:

   - Open a text editor and create a new file with a `.sh` extension, like `myscript.sh`.
   - Write your script in the file.

2. **Make the Script Executable**:

   - Before running a script, you need to give it execute permissions:
     ```bash
     chmod +x myscript.sh
     ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   - You can run the script by typing:
     ```bash
     ./myscript.sh
     ```

### Example Shell Script

Here’s a simple script that greets the user, shows the current date and time, and lists all files in the current directory:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Greet the user
echo "Hello, $USER!"

# Display the current date and time
echo "The current date and time is: $(date)"

# List files in the current directory
echo "Here are the files in your current directory:"
ls -l
```

### Advanced Features

- **Arguments**: You can pass arguments to a script, and they can be accessed using `$1`, `$2`, etc.
  ```bash
  echo "First argument: $1"
  ```
- **Input/Output Redirection**: You can redirect input and output using `>`, `<`, `>>`, and `|`.
  ```bash
  ls > files.txt  # Save the output of ls to a file
  ```
- **Error Handling**: Use conditional statements and special variables like `$?` to handle errors in your script.
  ```bash
  cp file1.txt file2.txt
  if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
      echo "Copy succeeded."
  else
      echo "Copy failed."
  fi
  ```

### Summary

Shell scripting is a powerful tool in Linux that allows you to automate tasks, manage systems, and create custom workflows. By writing scripts, you can efficiently perform complex tasks with a few lines of code. Whether you're a system administrator, developer, or just a casual Linux user, learning shell scripting can greatly enhance your productivity.

# Linux Command

If you're dealing with filenames that aren't human-readable (for example, they might be encoded, contain non-printable characters, or are just difficult to read due to unusual characters), you can use several techniques to convert or interpret these filenames into a more human-readable format.

### 1. **Display Filenames with Non-Printable Characters:**

- To reveal non-printable characters in filenames, use the `ls` command with the `-b` option:
  ```bash
  ls -b
  ```
  - This will show non-printable characters as escape sequences, making it easier to understand what's in the filename.

### 2. **Use `file` Command to Identify File Type:**

- The `file` command can help determine the type of file, which might give clues to what the filename represents:
  ```bash
  file filename
  ```
  - Replace `filename` with the actual name of the file. The output will describe the file type, which might hint at the content and thus a more human-readable name.

### Summary:

- Use `ls -b` to view filenames with non-printable characters as escape sequences.
- Use `mv` to rename files to something more human-readable.
- Use `file` to identify the file type, which might help in understanding its purpose and choosing a better name.

The command `find -type f -size 1033c` is used in Unix/Linux to search for files within a directory and its subdirectories based on specific criteria. Let's break it down:

### Components of the Command:

1. **`find`**:

   - This is the command used to search for files and directories in a directory hierarchy.

2. **`-type f`**:

   - `-type` is an option that specifies the type of item you're looking for.
   - `f` indicates that you're looking for regular files (as opposed to directories, symbolic links, etc.).

3. **`-size 1033c`**:
   - `-size` is an option that allows you to search for files based on their size.
   - `1033c` specifies the exact size of the files you're searching for.
   - `c` stands for "bytes," meaning the command is looking for files that are exactly 1033 bytes in size.

### What the Command Does:

- **`find -type f -size 1033c`** searches the current directory and all its subdirectories for files that are exactly 1033 bytes in size.

### Example Usage:

Suppose you want to find all files in the current directory and its subdirectories that are exactly 1033 bytes long:

```bash
find . -type f -size 1033c
```

- **`.`**: Represents the current directory. You can replace `.` with another directory path if you want to search elsewhere.

### Example Output:

If the command finds files that match the criteria, it will list them like this:

```bash
./subdir1/file1.txt
./subdir2/file2.log
```

### Summary:

- `find -type f -size 1033c` is used to locate all regular files that are exactly 1033 bytes in size within the specified directory and its subdirectories.

The difference in the outputs of the two commands is due to the handling of error messages and the exact file size being searched for.

### Let's break down what's happening:

1. **First Command:**

   ```bash
   find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 32c
   ```

   - This command searches for files owned by the user `bandit7`, in the group `bandit6`, with a size of exactly **32 bytes**.
   - The `find` command generates a lot of "Permission denied" errors because it attempts to search directories that the `bandit6` user doesn't have permission to access.
   - Because the errors are not suppressed, they clutter the output, making it difficult to see the results (if there are any).

2. **Second Command:**

   ```bash
   find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 32c 2>/dev/null
   ```

   - This is the same search as the first command, but with `2>/dev/null` added.
   - The `2>/dev/null` part redirects all error messages (`stderr`, which is file descriptor 2) to `/dev/null`, effectively hiding them.
   - As a result, you only see the files that match the search criteria, without any "Permission denied" messages.

3. **Third Command:**
   ```bash
   find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null
   ```
   - This command searches for files owned by `bandit7`, in the group `bandit6`, but this time with a size of exactly **33 bytes**.
   - It returns the path to a file (`/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password`) because this file matches the criteria (owned by `bandit7`, group `bandit6`, and 33 bytes in size).
   - The `cat` command then reveals the password contained in this file.

- **Suppressing Errors**: Using `2>/dev/null` hides the "Permission denied" errors, allowing you to see only the files that meet the criteria. Without this, the output includes a lot of noise from these errors.

If you have a file and you want to find the lines that occur only once:

1. **Sort** the file: This groups identical lines together.
2. **Use `uniq -u`**: This option prints only the unique lines that appear exactly once.

```bash
sort filename | uniq -u
```

The command `strings data.txt | grep "="` is used to search for and print lines containing the `=` character within a file. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

### Breakdown of the Command:

1. **`strings data.txt`**:

   - The `strings` command extracts printable strings from a binary file or any file with non-text content.
   - It looks for sequences of at least 4 printable characters (letters, digits, and symbols) in the file `data.txt` and outputs them.
   - This command is typically used when you need to extract readable text from a file that might contain binary data or a mix of binary and text data.

2. **`|` (Pipe)**:

   - The pipe `|` takes the output of the `strings` command and passes it as input to the next command, which in this case is `grep`.

3. **`grep "="`**:
   - `grep` is used to search for lines that match a specified pattern—in this case, the pattern is the `=` character.
   - It will output all lines from the `strings` command that contain the `=` character.

### What the Command Does:

- **`strings data.txt`** extracts all the human-readable text from `data.txt`.
- **`grep "="`** filters this output to show only those lines that include the `=` character.

### Example Scenario:

If `data.txt` contains a mix of binary data and text like this:

```
Binary content
key1=value1
key2=value2
Random binary data
```

Running:

```bash
strings data.txt | grep "="
```

Might output:

```
key1=value1
key2=value2
```

This is useful for extracting key-value pairs or configuration settings embedded within a file that is not entirely plain text.
